Using Python 3

To get started:
If you use different versions of Python and libraries, install a virtual environment:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/

Packages:
`pip3 install Flask`

If you're using Cloud9, add `--user` to the end of both of those commands


Notes:
I all libraries on the html side use CDNs
